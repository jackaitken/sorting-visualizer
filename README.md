# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Hello! Welcome to my sorting algorithm visualizer. This project was made using React as a way for me to better learn some of the more prevalent sorting algorithms in a more visual way. You can find the live project [here] (https://jackaitkensortvisualizer.netlify.app/) if you would like to play around with it. For the best results I would use Google Chrome. To get started simply set the speed of the animation and size of the array and click a sorting option.  

Each sorting algorithm has a brief description below the visualization that will appear after the algorithm has been selected. I also inlcuded a legend that should help you follow the algorithm as the animation runs. 

I had a blast creating this with React and I learned a lot about the library, and the algorithms of course.  

Please feel free to fork this repository to run it locally, and if you notice and bugs or have suggestions for improvements, always feel free to create an issue. Hope you enjoy it!
